	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is a popular method for comparing Bayesian models based on their estimated predictive performance on new, unseen, data. As leave-one-out cross-validation is based on finite observed data, there is uncertainty about the expected predictive performance on new data. By modeling this uncertainty when comparing two models, we can compute the probability that one model has a better predictive performance than the other. Modeling this uncertainty well is not trivial, and for example, it is known that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We study the properties of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator and the related uncertainty estimates when comparing two models. We provide new results of the properties both theoretically in the linear regression case and empirically for multiple different models and discuss the challenges of modeling the uncertainty. We show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions, misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection in the skewness of the individual leave-one-out terms and the distribution of the error of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to infinity in certain situations. Based on the results, we also provide practical recommendations for the users of Bayesian LOO-CV for model comparison.},

We take the idea of stacking from the point estimation literature and generalize to the combination of predictive distributions, extending the utility function to any proper scoring rule, using Pareto smoothed importance sampling to efficiently compute the required leave-one-out posterior distributions and regularization to get more stability. We compare stacking of predictive distributions to several alternatives: stacking of means, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), pseudo-BMA using AIC-type weighting, and a variant of pseudo-BMA that is stabilized using the Bayesian bootstrap. Based on simulations and real-data applications, we recommend stacking of predictive distributions, with BB-pseudo-BMA as an approximate alternative when computation cost is an issue.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

We demonstrate that in many cases one can benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the predictions. The model built in the first step is referred to as the reference model and the operation during the latter step as predictive projection. The key characteristic of this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all available information including prior and that coming from the left out features. We review several methods that follow this principle and provide novel methodological contributions. We present a new projection technique that unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using fast leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps to understand the conditions under which the projective approach could be beneficial.

However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

	abstract = {Assessing goodness of fit to a given distribution plays an important role in computational statistics. The Probability integral transformation (PIT) can be used to convert the question of whether a given sample originates from a reference distribution into a problem of testing for uniformity. We present new simulation and optimization based methods to obtain simultaneous confidence bands for the whole empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the PIT values under the assumption of uniformity. Simultaneous confidence bands correspond to such confidence intervals at each point that jointly satisfy a desired coverage. These methods can also be applied in cases where the reference distribution is represented only by a finite sample. The confidence bands provide an intuitive ECDF-based graphical test for uniformity, which also provides useful information on the quality of the discrepancy. We further extend the simulation and optimization methods to determine simultaneous confidence bands for testing whether multiple samples come from the same underlying distribution. This multiple sample comparison test is especially useful in Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics. We provide numerical experiments to assess the properties of the tests using both simulated and real world data and give recommendations on their practical application in computational statistics workflows.},

We show that it is possible to construct an unbiased estimator considering a specific predictive performance measure and model. We demonstrate an unbiased sampling distribution variance estimator for the Bayesian normal model with fixed model variance using the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd) utility score. This example demonstrates that it is possible to obtain improved, problem-specific, unbiased estimators for assessing the uncertainty in LOO-CV estimation.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$. On this approximate eigenbasis the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(nm{\textasciicircum}2)\$ (initial) and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(m{\textasciicircum}3)\$ (hyperparameter learning) with \$m\$ basis functions and \$n\$ data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function is increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}1/m\$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.},

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

We instead propose a new class of shrinkage priors for linear regression via specifying a prior first on the model fit, in particular, the coefficient of determination, and then distributing through to the coefficients in a novel way. The proposed method compares favourably to previous approaches in terms of both concentration around the origin and tail behavior, which leads to improved performance both in posterior contraction and in empirical performance. The limiting behavior of the proposed prior is \$1/x\$, both around the origin and in the tails. This behavior is optimal in the sense that it simultaneously lies on the boundary of being an improper prior both in the tails and around the origin. None of the existing shrinkage priors obtain this behavior in both regions simultaneously. We also demonstrate that our proposed prior leads to the same near-minimax posterior contraction rate as the spike-and-slab prior.},

Here we provide a tutorial on bridge sampling (Bennett, 1976; Meng \& Wong, 1996), a reliable and relatively straightforward sampling method that allows researchers to obtain the marginal likelihood for models of varying complexity. First, we introduce bridge sampling and three related sampling methods using the beta-binomial model as a running example. We then apply bridge sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood for the Expectancy Valence (EV) model—a popular model for reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that bridge sampling provides accurate estimates for both a single participant and a hierarchical version of the EV model. We conclude that bridge sampling is an attractive method for mathematical psychologists who typically aim to approximate the marginal likelihood for a limited set of possibly high-dimensional models.},

A natural way to assess the goodness of the model is to estimate its future predictive capability by estimating expected utilities. Instead of just making a point estimate, it is important to obtain the distribution of the expected utility estimate because it describes the uncertainty in the estimate. The distributions of the expected utility estimates can also be used to compare models, for example, by computing the probability of one model having a better expected utility than some other model. We propose an approach using cross-validation predictive densities to obtain expected utility estimates and Bayesian bootstrap to obtain samples from their distributions. We also discuss the probabilistic assumptions made and properties of two practical cross-validation methods, importance sampling and k-fold cross-validation. As illustrative examples, we use multilayer perceptron neural networks and gaussian processes with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in one toy problem and two challenging real-world problems.},

An advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of non-nested models as well as nested ones.
